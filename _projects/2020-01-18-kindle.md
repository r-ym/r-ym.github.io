Over New Years I decided to buy a Kindle. My mother will attest to this. On the 1st I woke up, brushed washed, then sat down for breakfast with family to declare my intentions. Prior to the 1st I had done all the possible research on variants, pricing, deals etc. Everything was deliberated on save for the final decision. I knew All the books that had hitherto eluded me by way cost and availability would be within reach. Project Gutenberg, BookFi Library Genesis would bridge that schism, all I needed to do was....... I went to Akihabara a determined man.
