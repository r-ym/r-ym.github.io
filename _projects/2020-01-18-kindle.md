Over New Years I decided to buy a Kindle. My mother will attest to this. On the 1st I woke up, brushed and washed, sat down for breakfast with family and declared my intentions to minimal impact. Prior to the 1st I had done all the possible research on variants, price points, deals etc. Everything was measured save for the decision of whether I wanted to go through with it or not. The answer drifted in that night instead of sleep. All the books that had hitherto eluded me to cost and availability would be within reach. Poject Gutenberg, BookFi Library Genesis would bridge that schism, all I needed to do was step on. I went to Akihabara a determined man.
