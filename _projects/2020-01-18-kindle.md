Over New Years I decided to buy a Kindle. My mother will attest to this. On the 1st I woke up, brushed washed, then sat down for breakfast with family to declare my intentions. No one cared in particular. Prior to the 1st I had done all the possible research on variants, pricing, deals etc. Everything was deliberated. I just needed to commit. I knew All the books that had hitherto eluded me by way of cost and availability would be within reach. Project Gutenberg, BookFi, Library Genesis would bridge that yawning, aching gap. I have bought one since and the schism's ache is now within me, subsumed.
