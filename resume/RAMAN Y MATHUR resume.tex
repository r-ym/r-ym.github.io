\hfill
Nov '19 - Jan '20\\
\begin{itemize}
\setlength\itemsep{0.01em}
\item[--]Worked with a team towards developing a quantum-computing backend that supports conventional quantum logical gates and algorithms. Done in Rust and WASM.
\item[--]Wrote custom quantum gate logic for the front-end using IBM's OpenQASM specifications to facilitate complex quantum circuits.
\end{itemize}
\noindent{\textbf{R\&D Intern at Johnson Matthey \textbar\ Clean Air}, Pennsylvania}

%2014\\
%Paper titled "Gene therapy as a means to treat cancer" won first prize among submissions from across India. Researched viral-vectors effectiveness in nucleic acid delivery, to determine feasibility for inducing apoptosis in tumour cells. Awarded a stipend, and invited for a month of research.\\
Sep '18 - April '19\\
\begin{itemize}
\setlength\itemsep{0.01em}
\item[--]Developed novel engine control catalysts via fundamental research and tailored synthesis methods.
\item[--]Analysed data from myriad testing methods (XRF, IV Vis etc.) to determine catalysis efficiency and feasibility in scaling. Worked extensively with Excel Macros.
\item[--]Collaborated with scientists from the Americas, EU, Japan and India on internal and external projects.

April '17 - Sep '17\\
\begin{itemize}
\setlength\itemsep{0.01em}
\item[--]Studied perovskite solar cells, and how materials such as Zinc Oxide nanorods and graphene-oxide / graphene composites can be used to improve photoconversion efficiency.
\item[--]Researched methods of graphene synthesis and deposition that paved way for a novel perovskite solar cell architecture.
\item[--]Constructed and programmed an Arduino-controlled spin coater for solar cell fabrication under a vacuum.
