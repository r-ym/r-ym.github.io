I stumbled upon D'angelo's music in high school. It was around 10th grade and I had just transitioned out of my mother's soul records to hone in on the Manchester sound and be a big man. While this was only a couple years ago music discovery was markedly different then, so was storage. Youtube was the prime resource to determine whether an artist fit your tastes. Once you found your mark you would do the needful torrenting. Storage limits were a lot more tangible pre-cloud, and each megabyte was territory to be carefully appraised then staked.

I believe I have experienced what I had wished for then. Lust in varying hues, and the charms and turbulence of passion. Despite going through that gauntlet Voodoo still remains the album closer to me. Maybe because we eventually learn that the joy in fleeting affections is just as fleeting.

2 years before my arrival in the Amerikkka's Black Messiah dropped. It was hard to  wrap your head around. Prince textures, disembodied voices, that man Pino on bass. This is where the myth of D'angelo came to an end. The perfect body and cheekbones on Untitled gave way to a man jaded on beauty. For a reason that was then alien to me. He talked
