I stumbled upon D'angelo's music in high school. It was around 10th grade and I had just transitioned out of American pop-punk and honed in on British indie and Manchester sound to be a big man. While only a couple years ago music discovery was markedly different then, so was storage. Youtube was the prime resource to ascertain whether an artist fit your tastes, and it's algorithms remain excellent to this day. Once you found your mark your browser would slide into sketchy domains of the internet of its own accord and did the needful torrenting. Storage limits were a lot more tangible pre-cloud, and each megabyte was territory to be carefully appraised then staked. In that economy of space it was a amazing to find an artist with only 2 albums to his discography. Both works of Dionysian sensuality that I had never exoerienced before
