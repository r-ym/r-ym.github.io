This post has been a long time in the making, and my thoughts on the topic assume and lose shape endlessly.

The first encounter was in the UK. Prior to my arrival there I did acid for the first time. Actually, on the night before my flight to Heathrow. For reasons I still do not understand I came out a changed man after I touched that innocuous postage stamp to my tongue. Owing to my upbringing I had been very reserved with people and wary of people's intentions. Surging tides of emotions swept that murk away as the wonder of human individuality and diversity dawned on me, love felt almost tangible as I sat at the edge of a creek watching bubbles rise and fall in the froth of a little waterfall. Seeing leaves caught in little eddies going nowhere in an otherwise violent river seemed very significant to a brain seeing connections between the most disparate data-points. Ensconced in these new revelations, I felt safer. It felt okay to accept company, and it was now alright to like others and to seek advice and to love.

I arrived at Heathrow primed, and I went about talking to anyone. It was insane, sustaining conversations with people for hours. It was exhilarating and it only lasted two months the first round. As my 4-hour sleep schedule started taking its toll my awareness inverted into it self and I was again trapped within. Frayed senses made being present impossible. Curiously it was only bad sleep that disrupted the barometer. It made words out of someones mouth grate and scrape across every part of my brain, and fuck. It was bad.
