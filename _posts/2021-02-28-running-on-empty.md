This post has been a long time in the making, and my thoughts on the topic assume and lose shape endlessly.

The first encounter was in the UK. Prior to my arrival there I had done acid for the first time. Actually, on the very night prior to my flight to Heathrow. For reasons still not understood I came out a changed man after putting that innocuous postage stamp to my tongue. Owing to emotional mishandling on the paternal side my childhood was somewhat rough, which unwittingly made me wary of most people. Surging tides of emotions swept that murk away as the wonder of human individuality and diversity dawned on me, love felt almost tangible as I sat at the edge of a creek watching bubbles rise and fall in the froth of a little waterfall. Everything was fastened together by a benevolence that piqued your curiosity and drew you outwards. Ensconced in this new revelation of metaphysics, I felt safer. It felt okay to accept company, even good to like others and to give and in turn receive love. Something little that we all learn growing up but apply in different measures across time, as gestures get pruned to make way for 'Ideologies' and other tensors.

I managed to finish up packing for my flight through this daze. Which was hard to do since every packed item triggered a tangential process deliberating NEED and WANTS. But I arrived at London somehow, primed to be on my EAT-PRAY-LOVE shit in a country notoriously against it. But Britain gets too much flack for its tight-lipped-white-upper-class people. On the contrary, the sense of community there fueled me. I now needed others to a scary degree. But it was exhilarating, sustaining conversations with people for hours, or finding myself in the most pleasantly random situations. But this hyper-activity only lasted two months the first round. As my 4-hour sleep schedule started taking its toll my awareness inverted into itself and I was again trapped within. Frayed senses made being present impossible. Curiously it was only bad sleep that disrupted the barometer. It made words out of someone else's mouth grate and scrape across every part of my brain, and fuck. It was bad.
