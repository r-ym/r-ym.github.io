Creating a website always seemed that one final step in renouncing personhood to become a brand, once you start a subscription service its over. Singularity. Your thoughts are beamed out to all your crony brain nodes via email every morning, once you take notes in your productive notes app of course. A brand eager to be hired no questions asked. "An algorithm to visually locate targets while simultaneously maiming them?? imma send you the code ASAP bossman" I realize that is a scenario I conjure to make myself seem more ethical. We are propped up on system scaffolded upon gross injustices, this isn't that weird slimy apologetics where we're supposed to prostrate ourselves because that is futile and disingenuous. Truly meaningful work in this context would be to dismantle the -isms now inherent to our lives. I honestly dont know how but fuck it we move.
