In the spirit of learning in public I want to lay bare all the domains and subdomains of knowledge I know I lack, and am striving towards in when I can. These will be grouped under three sets of Work, Life and Academic. Work will probably encompass programming, math and other tangential fields. Life will revolve around the passions that govern my waking life such as cooking, soccer but also the pleasures that make it worth it like family, friends and the joy of interaction. The Academic set will comprise of intrigues in academic fields I have sort of pruned from my professional life like biology, zoology and physics, but remain a mainstay through literature. There is already a book section so there will be a lot of cross-linkage in between. This makes me ponder whether a back-linking feature like Roam's would be worth adding to the site.
