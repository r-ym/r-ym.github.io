Creating a website always seemed that one final step in renouncing personhood to become a brand, once you start a Substack subscription service its over. Singularity. Thoughts beamed out to crony brain nodes via email every morning. A brand eager to be hired no questions asked. "An algorithm to visually locate targets while simultaneously maiming them?? imma send you the code ASAP bossman" I realize that is a scenario I conjure to make myself seem more ethical. We are propped up on system scaffolded upon gross injustices as it is -- this isn't that strain of apologetics where you're supposed to prostrate yourself. That is futile, disingenuous even. Truly meaningful work in this context would be to attempt to dismantle the inequity inherent to our lives. The racism embedded deep in USA's prosperity, the stream of brown and black blood that cut the channels for Amsterdam's cute photogenic canals, the bleakness under the veil of American imperialism etc.
