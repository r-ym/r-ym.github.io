Dont know what it is about Murdoch's aesthetic that makes it so distinctive. The elements are almost uniform, a character, their decisions, the subsequent muddle, a medium to swim in. All of it drifting on some indescribable ether in a universe similiar to ours save for one metaphysical law or the other. The way the characters grow and shrink in proportion is incredible. They seem grand one moment, and despicable the next, self-loathing at moments when you want to yank them and tell them they did the best they could. The hysterisis is jarring but Murdoch somehow cut through the muddle and you follow, albeit in a staggered manner.

What do you arrive at?
