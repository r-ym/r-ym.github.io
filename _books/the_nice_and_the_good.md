Dont know what it is about Murdoch's aesthetic that makes it so distinctive. The elements are almost uniform, a character, their decisions, the subsequent muddle, a medium for them to swim in. All of it drifting on some indescribable ether in a universe similiar to ours, save for one metaphysical law or the other. The way the characters grow and shrink in proportion. Seeming grand one moment, and despicable the next, self-loathing at times when you want to yank them and ask why. The hysterisis is jarring but Murdoch somehow cuts through the muddle and you follow suit, albeit in a janky staggered gait.

Where do you arrive at? What is communication and is it ever truthful within the web of our lives.

Coen-esque antics.
