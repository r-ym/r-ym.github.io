Let me set the context. This is my favourite book. Which is a hard statement to make given the tempestuous nature of the relationships we form with art. Favourite in what regard ? That is even harder to answer. A ghost town traversed to meet your end, but also illuminate in the process. Within Calvino's recursive function of short stories that is "If on a winters night a traveller" there is a story of man looking to find his father, with the dying words of his mother on his back. He is led to the village by a man who holds a gun to him, which he does too. And they walk side by side in tense symmetry to the village gates. Here he finds proto-mothers, false fathers and incestuous siblings. This was my favourite iteration in that book. And given how Rolfo was a contemporary and friend to Cortazar I am sure Pedro Paramo was an influence to Calvino.
