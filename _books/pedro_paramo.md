Let me set the context. This is my favourite book. Which is a hard statement to make given the tempestuous relationships we form with art. Within Calvino's recursive function of short stories that is "If on a winters night a traveller" there is a story of man looking to find his father, with the dying words of his mother on his back. He is led to a village by a man who holds a gun to him, which he does too. And they walk side by side in tense symmetry to it's gates. Here he finds proto-mothers, false fathers and incestuous siblings. This was my favourite iteration in that book. And given how Rolfo was a contemporary and friend to Cortazar I am sure Pedro Paramo was an influence to Calvino.

To understand the past of an institution is a sizeable task. Especially if the geographical and personal bounds within arent easily circumscibable.
