                Worked on the back-end to Elyah's quantum computing simulator. Worked extensively in Rust. Went in with no prior experience in quantum computing, and due to the 6 month duration I had to quickly work up an adequate mental model that could take in complex quantum computing concepts and map them to a programmming basis.
                </p>
                <p>
                In the process I learnt a lot about the field's mathematical foundations, its history and the current state of quantum computing modalities. Quantum and classical computing are distinct and powerful in their own regards and I am eager to see how large-scale quantum computing will be actualised.

                 Conducted research on vehicle exhaust emissions control under the Clean Air Division. Specifically on Diesel oxidation catalysts. This involved extensive lab work and data-analysis on material chemistry and conversion dynamics, while also taking into account the costs of scaling from lab to production level.

                  First experience in a b2b corporation where I learnt more about the forces that shape scientific research in a corporate institution. An immensely educational experience.

                  Conducted research on perovskite solar cells at the <a href="http://users.sussex.ac.uk/~qc25/index.html" style="font-weight:normal">Chen Nanoscience Lab</a> under Professor Qiao Chen. This entailed fabrication and the study of fabrication methods along with extensive testing to gauge photoconversion efficiency and cell longevity.

                  Incredibly grateful to everyone in the group for their support and allowing me to play a part. The steady acceleration to the erosion of our environment concerns and pains me to no end, and it soothes me to know that there exist teams like Prof Chen's working towards sustainability.
