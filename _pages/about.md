Here is my [resume](https://r-ym.github.io/resume/resume.pdf).<br />
Below are reviews and musings on the books I have on my Kindle. I write these to refine what I understood of the text by whittling away at every intuition and insight. As for cookbooks, maybe recipe attempts and their respective successes and failures.<br />
The Posts are auto-generated from my library so most are empty. I still put them up to push me to review what I have read and hold myself accountable to you, the dear reader. Once I do review them the text will be hyperlinked.
