                  I work closely with designers and product managers on cross-functional teams to launch experiments in
                  the form of prototypes and A/B tests. As well as this, I contribute to our company-wide design system
                  and component library with an emphasis on accessibility.
                </p>
                <p>
                  By my own initiative, I also train full-stack engineers in modern front-end practices with workshops
                  and in pairing sessions for our production codebase.

                  Here I built a one-to-many chat application to handle many thousands of customer interactions at
                  Tabiko.ai. It offers a high performance UI to manage payments, itineraries and travel-related search.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I introduced practices such as Test-Driven-Development and code-reviews to bring the engineering team
                  to new levels of productivity.

                  Here I helped build <em>Dimare</em>, a work-shift management software for several restaurant chains in
                  South-East-Asia. I worked closely with designers to realize the UX vision for the product, while also
                  consulting with our clients to identify their use-cases and pain-points.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I worked with a team of six developers, learning about advanced state management, agile methodology
                  and javascript best-practices.
