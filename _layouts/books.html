Below are reviews and musings on the books I have on my Kindle. I write these to refine what I understood of the text by whittling away at every intuition and insight. As for cookbooks, I catalog recipe attempts of mine and their respective successes and failures.<br />
    The Posts are auto-generated from Calibre library via a custom gem. Most reviews are unfinished but I have left them up to hold myself accountable to you, the dear reader. Once I complete reviewing a certain book it's title will be hyperlinked.
{% for book in site.books %}
  {% if book.link%}
    <article role="article"></article>
    <h4><a href="{{ site.baseurl }}{{ book.url }}">
      {{ book.title }}
    </a></h4>
    </article>
  {% else %}
    <article role="article"></article>
    <h4>
      {{ book.title }}
    </h4>
    </article>
  {% endif %}
{% endfor %}
