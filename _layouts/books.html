Below are reviews and musings on the books I have on my Kindle. I write these to refine what I understood of the text by whittling away at every intuition and insight. As for cookbooks, attempts at recipes and their respective successes and failures.<br />
<br />
The Posts are auto-generated from Calibre library via a custom gem. Most reviews are unfinished but I have left them up to hold myself accountable to you, the dear reader. Once I complete reviewing a certain book it's title will float upwards, hyperlinked.<br />

{% for book in site.books %}
  {% if book.link %}
    <article role="article"></article>
    <b><a href="{{ site.baseurl }}{{ book.url }}">{{ book.title }}</b></a> <i>by {{ book.author }}</i>
    </article>
  {% endif %}
{% endfor %}
